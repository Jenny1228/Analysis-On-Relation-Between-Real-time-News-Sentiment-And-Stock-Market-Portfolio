# Analysis-On-Relation-Between-Real-time-News-Sentiment-And-Stock-Market-Portfolio
In this project, we use two sets of data to draw insights on how media sentiment can be an indicator for the financial sector. For the financial data, we plan to use daily return of the market index &lt;font color='green'>(^GSPC)&lt;/font>, which is a good indicator for market fluctuation; for media sentiment, we use summarized information of news pieces from top 10 most popular press because of their stronger influence in shaping people's perception of events that are happening in the world.**  **Both sets of data are real-time, which means the source files are of the moment and need to be loaded each time analysis is performed. The sentiment analysis library returns a &lt;font color='green'>polarity&lt;/font> score (-1.0 to 1.0) and a &lt;font color='green'>polarity&lt;/font> score (0.0 to 1.0) on the news stories. Using quantified sentiment analysis, we juxtapose the two time series of data and observe if they present any correlation and search for potential causality. For example, we may test the hypothesis that when polarity among the daily news posts is higher (a.k.a., positive), the financial market that same day is more likely to rise. The rest of the notebook is a step-by-step instruction.
